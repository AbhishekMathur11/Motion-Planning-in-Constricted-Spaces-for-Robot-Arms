# Motion Planning in Constricted Spaces for Robot Arms


In many industrial applications, robot arms are required to perform more precise tasks as opposed to trivial pick and place operations and these might occur in constricted spaces where the chances of a collision are higher. Hence, this project focuses on the implementation of key motion planning algorithms for a Franka Emika Panda robot arm inside a box environment with an obstacle and the goal is for the arm to plan a path from one side of the obstacle to the other, simulating a real world object transfer application.
